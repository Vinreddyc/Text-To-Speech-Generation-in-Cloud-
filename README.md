# Text-To-Speech-Generation-in-Cloud-
This project uses AWS Polly to generate speech from text and upload it onto AWS S3 automatically

For using AWS Polly you will need to install the following modules:
 boto3
 Used a Neural engine. (Hint: The neural engines are only available in 3 regions namely: US
East (N. Virginia): us-east-1, US West (Oregon): us-west-2, EU (Ireland): eu-west-1, use
these regions.)
 At least 5-6 Speech Synthesis Mark-up Language (SSML) tags, also tags with effects for
implementation.
 Created an s3 bucket with the name “s3-bucket”.
 Uploaded the generated audio files into the “s3-bucket”.
